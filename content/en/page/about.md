Hello Dear Visitor, 

Welcome to my place. Relax and enjoy your coffee as you browse through some of the topics of your interest.

**WHY THIS BLOG?** 
The posts in this blog are about Statistics, Data Science/Machine Learning and Software Development (mainly in Python),
Since recent past, I am actively involved in data science and machine learning. 
I thought it would be convenient if I could put them all at one place. 
I plan to share information to a wider audience and enthusiasts. It would be fun if someone curious could also benefit from them.

I hope you will find something new and interesting.
