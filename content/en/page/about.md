Hello Dear Visitor, 

Welcome to my place. Relax and enjoy your coffee as you browse through some of the topics of your interest.

**WHY THIS BLOG?** 
The posts in this blog are about Statistics, Data Science/Machine Learning and Software Development (mainly in Python),
I plan to share information to a wider audience and enthusiasts. 

In recent past, I was actively learning basic concepts in data science and machine learning. I realised that there are many concepts that I am getting out of touch. So when I decided to refresh them, I got real frustrated when I could not find all of my hand-written notes. I just kept searching through my bookmarks and finally could find only a few jupyter noteboooks. 

I thought it would be convenient if I could put them all at one place - as I learn. And it would be more fun if someone curious could also benefit from them.

I hope you will find something new and interesting.
