## What is the Z Test?

z  tests are a statistical way of testing a hypothesis when either:

-   We know the population variance, or
-   We do not know the population variance but our sample size is large n â‰¥ 30

_If we have a sample size of less than 30 and do not know the population variance, then we must use a t-test._

### One-Sample Z test
**Compare a sample mean with the population mean.**
$$ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / n}$$


### Two Sample Z Test
**Compare the mean of two samples.**
$$ t = \frac{(\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{(\sqrt{\sigma{^2}{_1}/n_1 + \sigma{^2}{_2}/n_2})}$$

## What is the t-Test?
t-tests are a statistical way of testing a hypothesis when:

-   We do not know the population variance
-   Our sample size is small, n < 30

### One-Sample t-Test
$$ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / n}$$
We perform a One-Sample t-test when we want to **compare a sample mean with the population mean**. The difference from the Z Test is that we do **not have the information on Population Variance** here. We use the **sample standard deviation** instead of population standard deviation in this case.

### Two-Sample t-Test
We perform a Two-Sample t-test when we want to compare the mean of two samples.

$$ t = \frac{(\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{(\sqrt{s{^2}{_1}/n_1 + s{^2}{_2}/n_2})}$$

If the sample size is large enough, then the Z test and t-Test will conclude with the same results. For a **large sample size**, **Sample Variance will be a better estimate** of Population variance so even if population variance is unknown, we can **use the Z test using sample variance.**

Similarly, for a **Large Sample**, we have a high degree of freedom. And since t-distribution approaches the normal distribution**, the difference between the z score and t score is negligible.
